all day long i think of things but nothing seems to satisfy

think i'll lose my mind if i dont find something to pacify

i need someone to show me the things in life that i cant find

i cant see the things that make true happiness i must be blind

make a joke and i will sigh and you will laugh and i will cry

happiness i cannot feel and love to me is so unreal

and so as you read these words telling you now of my state

i tell you to enjoy life

i wish i could but its too late
